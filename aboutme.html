                <p>Hello my name is Nathan Behm I am 19 years old and come from a family of 8. 
                    I am from North Carolina and love to rock climb, go hiking, ride dirt bikes, anything outside. 
                    I also enjoy reading and football, I played football in highschool and intramural football in college.
                    I love to code in my free time, using softwares such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I got my Eagle Scout award 
                    in the spring of 2021, and live by the scout law and motto. </p>
                    <div class="paragraph_4">
                    <p>One major thing about me is I love being spontaneous and trying new things. So when I see something like a coding 
                        project I want to try I just start working on it. I love to see all the pieces come together to form something amazing. </p>
